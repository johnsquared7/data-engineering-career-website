# Data Engineering Fundamentals

## Definition of Data Engineering
Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining systems that make it possible to collect data, store it, analyze it, and make decisions based on it. It's one of the 'data providers' jobs, as its purpose is to make data accessible to other data users (e.g., data analysts, data scientists, ML engineers) while ensuring data quality, accuracy, and format suitability.

## Seven Core Fundamentals of Data Engineering

### 1. Data Sources and Ingestion
Data engineers typically pull data from many different sources and store it in one place, such as a data warehouse. This process is called data ingestion.

#### Data Source Types:
- **Structured Data Sources**: Data follows a predefined schema organized in tables (e.g., relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Semi-Structured Data Sources**: Data with some organization but no fixed schema (e.g., JSON files, XML files, HTML documents, emails)
- **Unstructured Data Sources**: Data lacking predefined data models (e.g., text documents, social media posts, videos, images)

#### Data Ingestion Methods:
- **Batch Processing**: Data is collected and processed at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily, weekly)
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Continuous data collection and processing as soon as it becomes available

#### Tools for Data Ingestion:
- Informatica PowerCenter
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Flume
- Apache NiFi
- AWS Glue
- Azure Data Factory

### 2. Data Storage and Management
Data storage involves selecting appropriate storage solutions based on data types, volume, and access patterns.

#### Storage Solutions:
- **Data Warehouses**: Structured repositories optimized for analytics (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery)
- **Data Lakes**: Storage repositories for raw, unprocessed data (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage)
- **Databases**: 
  - Relational (SQL): PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
  - NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage

#### Data Management Considerations:
- Data governance
- Security and access control
- Backup and recovery
- Scalability
- Cost optimization

### 3. Data Processing and Transformation
Converting raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

#### Processing Types:
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Traditional approach where data is transformed before loading
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: Modern approach where data is loaded first, then transformed as needed

#### Transformation Operations:
- Data cleaning
- Normalization
- Aggregation
- Filtering
- Joining multiple datasets
- Type conversion
- Enrichment

#### Processing Tools:
- Apache Spark
- Apache Hadoop
- Databricks
- dbt (data build tool)
- AWS Glue
- Azure Data Factory

### 4. Data Integration and Aggregation
Combining data from different sources into a unified view.

#### Integration Approaches:
- **Data Consolidation**: Bringing data together physically
- **Data Virtualization**: Creating a virtual layer over distributed data
- **Data Federation**: Querying distributed data sources without moving data

#### Aggregation Techniques:
- Summarizing data
- Grouping related information
- Creating dimensional models
- Building data marts

### 5. Data Quality and Validation
Ensuring data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable.

#### Data Quality Dimensions:
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Timeliness
- Validity
- Uniqueness

#### Validation Techniques:
- Data profiling
- Schema validation
- Business rule validation
- Anomaly detection
- Data lineage tracking

### 6. Data Modeling and Analysis
Creating conceptual representations of data and relationships.

#### Modeling Approaches:
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Star and snowflake schemas for analytics
- **Entity-Relationship Modeling**: For relational databases
- **Data Vault Modeling**: For enterprise data warehouses
- **Graph Modeling**: For highly connected data

#### Analysis Capabilities:
- SQL querying
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning integration

### 7. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Ensuring systems can handle growing data volumes and user demands.

#### Optimization Techniques:
- Indexing
- Partitioning
- Caching
- Query optimization
- Parallel processing
- Resource allocation
- Distributed computing

#### Performance Considerations:
- Throughput
- Latency
- Concurrency
- Resource utilization
- Cost efficiency
